This tool requires a modern browser. Different browsers and fonts behave differently; if you aren't happy with the
results you get, try a different browser or font.

Due to privacy concerns, it's not possible for a browser to build a list of all fonts installed on your system. Open
a word processor or paint program to find what fonts are available to you, and type the name of a font into the
**Font Name** box.
